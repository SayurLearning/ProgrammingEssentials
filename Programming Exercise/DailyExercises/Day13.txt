Problem #1
Input is a range of numbers as string. Print only the numbers that are palindromes and also the 
square of that number is also a palindrome.
eg. 121 is a palindrome and 121 * 121 = 14641 is also a palindrome, so you can print 121
131 is a palindrome, but 131*131 = 17161 is not a palindrome,so you can't print it.
eg input "10", "500"
Make sure to identify which steps need to be a function, how to avoid unnecessary parsing 
of numbers. Checking for palidrome or not, should be an efficient code.

Problem #2
Use switch stmt, think of all possible age as input.
Print if the user goes to kindergarten (age 3-6), primary school (7-11), ,middle school (12-15),
highschool (16-19), college (20-24).
Get users name and age as input.
Eg input Sam, 10
Output is Sam goes to primary school

Problem #3
Use switch stmt (no if stmts) to calculate the grade of the student based on marks
Grade A = mark >90
Grade B  between 80 and 90
Grade C between 60 and 80
Fail , below 60

Make sure to include code for all possible input values.
