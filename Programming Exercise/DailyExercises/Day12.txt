Problem #1
You have list of unique words. you input is a string with no spaces. Return true if the letters in the 
input string can be seperated into words that are in the list.
eg list = ["we", "students", "are" ]
input = "wearestudents"
output = true
eg 2 List = ["we", "doctor","and", "nurse", "are"]
input = "wearenurseandoctor"
output = False 
input = "wearenurseanddoctor"
output = true

Problem #2
Input is an integer list and another integer k. Output is the k most frequently occuring numbers.
output can be in any order.
eg input = [1,1,1,2,2,3,5,5,5,5], k =2
output [1,5] (top 2 most frequently occuring numbers)
input = [4,5,4,5,4,5,3,3,3,7,8,1,1,1], k = 4
output [4,5,3,1]
