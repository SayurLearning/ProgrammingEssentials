Problem #1
1. Check whether the given string input is a valid ip address.
Find out what are the constraints for an ip address (how many chars, what numbers are allowed, how many '.'
etc)
Write all constraints.
Get an input as string. Return if it is valid or not. 
Use string functions.

2. Same as above. Use regex.

3. Same as above, but the input is given without any . 
Print all possible ipaddress based on the contraints learnt in problem 1.
eg input - 0000
output 0.0.0.0
input 10026710
output 100.2.67.10
input 100242200
output 100.24.220.0, 100.242.20.0
