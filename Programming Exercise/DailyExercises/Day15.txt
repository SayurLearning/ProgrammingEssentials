   - Store match details like  date, venue, opponent team, and result.
   - Include information about the players participating in each match, their roles, and
    any specific statistics (runs scored, wickets taken, etc.) for that match.

3. **Teams:**
   - Details of the teams affiliated with the club, including  name, coach, and captain.

**Queries:**

1. Retrieve all players' details.
2. Get the details of matches played in a specific venue.
3. List all matches where a particular player participated.
4. Find players with a batting average above a certain value.
5. Display the team details along with the list of players in each team.
