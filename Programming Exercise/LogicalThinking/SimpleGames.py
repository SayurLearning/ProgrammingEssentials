Points are added to each roll.

2 - 5 pts
3 - 15 pts
4 - (-15) pts
5 - (-5) pts
6 - (-1) pts

Find which player scores 100 first and how many time they had to roll the die.
Hint - use random numbers to generate the die (no need to get user input)
Use Arrays and while loop.

Problem #3
Write an app for the follwoing two player game. You have a 6 x 6 board. 
Users take turns rolling the dice twice. first roll is row no, second roll is col number. Mark the spot (row, col) as claimed by the user
who rolled the dice.
When the user rolls the dice within 1 col/row of a claimed spot of the other user, the other user gets a point. 
If the spot is same as the claimed spot of the other user, the user that rolled the dice gets a point. 
The player who gets 5 points first wins the game.
